Clicking will toggle the red LED attached to Digital Pin 3

Changing the Potentiometer will make the background change from black to white (greyscale)

12 - [Controller Assignment](Controller/index.html)

The joystick controls the movement of the cursor (black circle)
Clicking the joystick in will act as clicking and squish any bugs under the cursor
The output for this was meant to be a buzzer, but this doesn't seem to work. It may be my wiring or I may just have the code wrong.
Instead, the on-board LED lights up for .333 seconds before turning off when a bug is squished.
